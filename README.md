# CS 52 Syllabus (Spring 2020)

### Current Announcements
- The Zoom link will be the same for every Tuesday session. It will be sent out over email, and we suggest you save it in your Calendar along with your weekly instance of this class for fast access. We are not posting it here to ensure that you are the only ones who have access to it.
- Thursday Zoom links will depend on your SGM time. Read below.

### How will this quarter work?
This quarter you will implement the idea that you ideated and prototyped in the winter. You should plan on being available to attend class on Zoom during our regularly scheduled class times. We will be conducting class in different formats on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
* Tuesdays: Lecture, speaker, or team presentations
* Thursdays: SGMs (see below for an exlaination of SGMs)

Refer to the syllabus below for a planned schedule for the quarter.

### Class times
* Tuesdays: Class will occur every Tuesday over Zoom from 6:30pm - 8:00pm Pacific Time, unless it is noted on the syllabus that there will not be class that day
* Thursdays: Instead of class, you will have your SGMs. You should still block off 6:30-8pm because your SGM should occur during this time. More on scheduling SGMs during our first class.

#### What are SGMs?
An SGM, or Small Group Meeting, is a concept borrowed from CS 210. We will run our SGMs in much the same format. Each SGM will be a 30 minute meeting between the team and their teaching team coach, and may also include other members of the teaching team. The meeting will start off with some check-in questions from the coach to get a sense of your team's progress. After that, the rest of the meeting should be run by the team. Your goal during the SGM is to come together as a team to debrief on what you have done since the last meeting, make key decisions together, create milestones, and divide up work so that each individual knows what they are responisble for completing before the next deadline or meeting.

#### Attendance Policy
You are expected to attend all virtual class sessions on Tuesdays and your scheduled SGM time on Thursdays. You are allowed up to three absenses during the quarter for any reason. For any absense, please communicate with your teaching team coach ahead of time that you will not be able to make it. We understand that things are very up in the air this quarter and that unforeseen circumstances may cause you to miss class sessions. We will try to be accomodating, but it is essential that you communicate with the teaching team.

#### Team Github Pages
- When teams create their own Github repos for their projects, they will be linked here

### Piazza
We'll be using Piazza this quarter to help students with course issues. Sign up to the Piazza class here: piazza.com/stanford/spring2020/cs52
