# CS 52 Syllabus (Spring 2020)

### Current Announcements
- The Zoom link will be the same for every Tuesday session. It will be sent out over email, and we suggest you save it in your Calendar along with your weekly instance of this class for fast access. We are not posting it here to ensure that you are the only ones who have access to it.
- Thursday Zoom links will depend on your SGM time. Read below.

### How will this quarter work?
This quarter you will implement the idea that you ideated and prototyped in the winter. You should plan on being available to attend class on Zoom during our regularly scheduled class times. We will be conducting class in different formats on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
* Tuesdays: Lecture, speaker, or team presentations
* Thursdays: SGMs (see below for an exlaination of SGMs)

Refer to the syllabus below for a planned schedule for the quarter.

### Class times
* Tuesdays: Class will occur every Tuesday over Zoom from 6:30pm - 8:00pm Pacific Time, unless it is noted on the syllabus that there will not be class that day
* Thursdays: Instead of class, you will have your SGMs. You should still block off 6:30-8pm because your SGM should occur during this time. More on scheduling SGMs during our first class.

#### What are SGMs?
An SGM, or Small Group Meeting, is a concept borrowed from CS 210. We will run our SGMs in much the same format. Each SGM will be a 30 minute meeting between the team and their teaching team coach, and may also include other members of the teaching team. The meeting will start off with some check-in questions from the coach to get a sense of your team's progress. After that, the rest of the meeting should be run by the team. Your goal during the SGM is to come together as a team to debrief on what you have done since the last meeting, make key decisions together, create milestones, and divide up work so that each individual knows what they are responisble for completing before the next deadline or meeting.


#### SGM Zoom Links
Find the Zoom links for each team's SGM [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewlaj5yy0hnKWzkQFNbVL7PoqbBdNfcxpaX8lr4BmTA/edit?usp=sharing). (Note: you'll need to use your Stanford account to access this link. This is to protect others outside of the class from access the Zoom links to our private meetings)

#### Attendance Policy
You are expected to attend all virtual class sessions on Tuesdays and your scheduled SGM time on Thursdays. You are allowed up to three absenses during the quarter for any reason. For any absense, please communicate with your teaching team coach ahead of time that you will not be able to make it. We understand that things are very up in the air this quarter and that unforeseen circumstances may cause you to miss class sessions. We will try to be accomodating, but it is essential that you communicate with the teaching team.

#### Team Github Pages
Each team will have their own team and repository under the CS52 Github organization. They are linked in the table below. You should've already received an invitation to be a part of these teams, if you haven't, please reach out to Jose. 
We'll go more in depth into how to use Github after the bootcamp but Github will be your friend when it comes to remote development.

#### Piazza

#### Office Hours
The teaching team will be holding office hours online this quarter. Office hours are a resource available to you so feel free to sign up if you ever need help, it need not be technical. To sign up for office hours, please go to the link below, select the instructor you want to meet with, and sign up for office hours using the link posted next to their names. We'll be using Calendly to manage office hour slots. 

You can find the signup for each Teaching Team member's Office Hours [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1suz9DvELHCBOkqkILEXxiCQQhhZhwO1ofSnInSawn6o/edit?usp=sharing).
(Note: you'll need to use your Stanford account to access this link. This is to protect the privacy of the teaching team)

Office hours are all 15 minutes long, if you need longer, please email the teaching team member you want to talk to. Also, if none of the times work, feel free to email us.

#### Slack
We'll continue to use Slack this quarter to message you all. If you haven't already, please turn on notifications on the main channel. We'll make sure to use the @channel tag on any important announcements so feel free to turn off every other kind of notification. We also encourage you to create a Slack channel for your team since that will help with distributed work.
